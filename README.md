# Pygame Projects Collection

This repository contains a diverse collection of interactive projects and games developed using Pygame, showcasing various techniques from 3D rendering to algorithm visualization and multiplayer gaming.

## Featured Projects

### 3D Graphics & Visualizations
- **3D Sphere Representation**: Interactive rotating 3D sphere with depth cueing and smooth rotation controls
- **Raycasting with Moving Obstacles**: Dynamic raycasting visualization with bouncing obstacles
- **Bubble Sort Visualization**: Real-time animation of the Bubble Sort algorithm

### Interactive Games
- **AirWre Game**: 2D airplane combat game with multiple plane types, abilities, and online multiplayer
- **Multiplayer Grid Game**: Network-based strategy game with synchronized grid movement
- **Infinite Grid Strategy Game**: Expandable foundation for a strategy game with infinite grid navigation

### Unique Experiments
- **Sound Interaction Game**: Game controlled by real-time audio analysis and musical notes
- **Circle Path & Editor**: Pathfinding visualization with interactive level editing tools

## Common Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation
```bash
pip install pygame
```

Some projects may require additional dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pyaudio  # For sound-based projects
```

## How to Run Projects
Each project contains its own main file, typically named `main.py`. Navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
